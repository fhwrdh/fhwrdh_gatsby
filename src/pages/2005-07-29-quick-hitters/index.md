Since the blogger comment system and I weren't getting along, I'll mention it here: Congratulations man. Cold turkey is a brutal way to do it, and not the way we talked about :) - but I wish you the best. Gimme a holler if I can do anything to help get you through the tough patches.

As the father of an 8 year old autistic boy, allow me say that <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05210/545643.stm">mark downs jr</a>. is a piece of shit. No love for him.

Finally, <a href="http://www.billrini.com/index.php/2005/07/28/big-announcement-coming-tomorrow/">brini </a>has a big announcement to make today. Show him some love. Personally, I'm looking very forward to whatever that announcement is.
