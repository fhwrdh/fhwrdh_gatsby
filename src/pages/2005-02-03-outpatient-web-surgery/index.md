I gave the old web site a minor facelift last night. Added that middle column for a link blog of sorts. I adapted my existed blogging code do that I can just add links (poker or otherwise) and the freshest 10 or so will display. I also tweaked the color scheme slighly, trying to make things more readable. I know the fonts are too small. I try every once in a while to embiggen them, but I can't bring myself to do it. It just looks too crappy. Sorry.
