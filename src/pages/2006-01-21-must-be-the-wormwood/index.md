Probably not really news at this point as many are talking about it, but Hdouble home game regular and fellow geek <a href="http://cardplayer.com/poker-tournaments/view/name/Ryan_Kallberg&amp;year=&amp;name_id=35448">Ryan</a> headed down to the local pokerhaus last night and picked himself up some of that six-figure type money they were handing out.

Now go fill up <a href="http://www.absinthetics.com/blog/">his blog </a>comments with backslapping and gladhanding. If you are lucky, he might stake you or buy you a drink.
