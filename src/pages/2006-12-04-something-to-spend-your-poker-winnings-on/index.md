The Velvet Underground is an important band for me.

Bloggsy points out that the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/VELVET-UNDERGROUND-NICO-1966-Acetate-LP-ANDY-WARHOL_W0QQitemZ300054910309QQihZ020QQcategoryZ306QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem">ebay</a> auction for the ultra-rare (as in one copy) VU acetate from 1966 is now up over $110k.

In 2002, the record was purchased at a street sale in New York, with two other records, for 75 cents.
