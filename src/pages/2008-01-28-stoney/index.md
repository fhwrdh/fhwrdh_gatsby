Spent some time yesterday in the cemetery. While facty was off looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching">stuff</a>, I took some photos.

This is the headstone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Johnstone_Stoney">George Johnstone Stoney</a>, best known for inventing the term "<a href="http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Stoney-1894.html">electron</a>" in 1894. According to Wikipedia, he was the first to estimate the number of molecules in a cubic millimeter of gas. He has craters on the moon and Mars named for him (as well as a street near the cemetery, Stoney Road) and was a distant relative of Alan Turing.

Nerdtastic.
