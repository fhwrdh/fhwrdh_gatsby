I've been catching up on a backlog of poker blog reading...

If I had a nickel for every time <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blogger+ate+my+post">blogger ate someone's post</a>, I'd be able to move up in limits. Sheesh.

Now, I'm no expert in blogger's software (I'd venture to guess that I'm the sole poker blogger using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor</a>, and I won't even get into the virtues of using a tool so powerful), but it seems like an easy thing to write one's post in a tool that will allow one to save said post to one's hard drive occasionally. Then, when ready to publish, a quick copy and paste should do the trick.

Notepad, anyone?
