Oh sure, I could apologize again for the lack of updates and make excuse after excuse about the <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com">new job</a>, the helping friends and acquaintances with their website needs, the wife out of town for a long weekend leaving me with the kids, etc. But I'm not going to make excuses. the facts are that I simply haven't been inspired to write about poker lately. My play has, until recently, been limited mostly to <a href="http://www.studioglyphic.com/mt/archives/2005/04/the_infamous_ho.html">the infamous home game</a> and the WSOP qualifiers on Stars put together by Iggy.

And its not that I'm running bad or the bankroll is gone and I just don't want to write about it. I cashed in my last home game. Before that, i busted out of a home tourney near the bubble, but then sat down at the cash table (with 4 other bloggers, no less) and proceeded to catch cards to the tune of a triple up.

As mentioned, I've been taking part in the blogger WSOP qualifiers, the latest of which was last night. Before the last one, I deposited a little extra in Stars with the idea of playing a little low limit cash game there also. Finally, Saturday night, I did.  $1/$2. [Puts thumbs in suspenders and rocks back on heels]. Yup, big stakes. But being away from online poker for a month or two and away from Stars for over a year, I wanted to ease back in to things.

Now, i don't dispute the common knowledge that there are more poor players at Party than anywhere else. But, man, this 6-max $1/$2 table was one of the juiciest tables I've experienced at any site, any limit. Truly terrible play. 2nd pair/no kicker and facing a bet and a raise on the turn when the 3rd flush card hits? Time to raise!

This was classic Ed Miller low limit. Most pots were raised preflop and still 3-4 handed on the turn. There were odds to chase even the weakest of draws, and I could hear Miller, "Don't fold on the river for one bet in a big pot." I also played much more aggressively postflop, raising with my strong draws and when I thought I could buy outs. And it worked. When I finally sat out I was up 46bb. Whew.

And to make the session complete, I even got called names:

[ fhwrdh wins huge pot with nut flush on the river ]

Dude-about-to-go-bust: fhwrdh, you are a chasing idiot

I didn't respond. a few hands later, I again call one small
bet on the flop with overcards and a flush draw. I hit top
pair on the turn and it held up.

Dude-about-to-go-bust: fh, you are a chasing idiot!

fhwrdh: I heard you the first time.

d-a-t-g-b: Ok, wasn't sure.

And with that he left.

The point is, regardless of results, I played well. I think. Either that or I'm a chasing idiot. Upon reflection,
perhaps my little hiatus from online poker was just what I needed to actually let some of the lessons I've read and
reread and reread finally sink in. That wasn't my goal with the break, but perhaps a nice side effect.
