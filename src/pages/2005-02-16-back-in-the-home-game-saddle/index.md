Not a lot of poker around here lately as I've been focused on my <a href="http://www.rhband.org">other time sucker</a> pretty solidly since the little blogger gathering at Commerce last month. We have no more performances scheduled, so I guess its time to lose the equipment in the garage again and go back to civilian life.

I even missed a couple of home games at the house of lkim, which is highly unusual for me. That changes tonight as <a href="http://pokergeek.blogspot.com/">thefilmgeek</a> joins me and 20+ others for the usual $20 + $5 bounty tourney. Checking out the evite, the pregame trash talk is at an all time high, so tonight should be lively. Report forthcoming...
