Check out <a href="http://pokergeek.blogspot.com/2005/02/very-well-i-accept.html">thefilmgeek</a> for the glorious details of his victory last night in lkim's home game. He is clearly on top of his game.

Me? .... not so much.

A couple of things in my defense. First, I didn't get much in the way of cards. Second, the lineup at my first table: Geek to my left. LAG coworker to his left. So much to stealing opportunities. The rest of the table featured lkim himself, new-guy-20/40-in-Vegas-bully, and Tien, who might looks like a petite little lady until she bluff-re-raises you all-in on a raggedy little flop. Yikes.

You'd never know we started with 2000 in chips and the first level was 5/10. the black 100 chips and the white 500 chips were flying early. And with no cards, I had to sit back and watch. I tried limping into a few pots with suited connectors, but couldn't connect with a flop. At level 3, blinds at 15/30, I finally got kings utg+1. It seemed like every hand had been raised, reraised, and overcalled, so i made a standard-ish raise (100), expecting fireworks. Fold, fold, fold, fold fold! I pick up a measly 45 in blinds. It was that kind of night.

Three tables became two and then one. I limped into the final table as a severe short stack with around 2500. Blinds were 100/200. I continued to tread water while chips flew around me. A couple of other short stacks went out and new-guy-20/40-in-Vegas-bully finally bullied his way into a confrontation with a big hand and was busted, much to his surprise.

We were down to 5 and I was super desperate to get some chips or bust out and get into the newly started cash game. I picked my spots and moved in preflop a few times, But no callers. I threw away 66 after a big raise from one of the big stacks, Brian, which I later regretted. One more player busted and we were down to 4. Bubble time. Thefilmgeek and Brian were dominating and Brian was wielding his big stack with frequent raises. Alicia, a new player, was closer to me in chips, but seemed content to fold her way to the money while I fought for my life. With the blinds at 250/500, I get 45s and push. No one has been calling my all-ins, and I figure if I get called, I'll have live cards. alicia calls and the Geek goes all-in over the top with KK. She folds and we flip them up. I did pick up a straight draw on the turn, but blank on the river.

I hit the cash game quickly and managed to make a few bucks back before new-guy-20/40-in-Vegas-bully took everyone else's money. I wasn't about to get into a no limit heads up cash game with the guy having a 5:1 chip advantage, so we broke the table.

Total for the night: -30 + 8 = -22
