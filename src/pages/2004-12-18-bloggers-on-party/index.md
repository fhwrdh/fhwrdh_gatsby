Well, shit, if I'm going to sit down at a table full of bloggers on Party Poker and chat it up, I better damn will write something so I can pretend I'm a poker blogger.

I knew it'd be a -ev situation to sit with <a href="http://guinnessandpoker.blogspot.com/">Iggy</a>, <a href="http://www.studioglyphic.com/mt/">Glyphic</a>, <a href="http://taopoker.blogspot.com/">Dr. Pauly</a>, <a href="http://helixx.livejournal.com/">Helixx</a>, <a href="http://sirfwalgman.blogspot.com/">Sirfwalgman</a>, <a href="http://slayrepokerquest.blogspot.com/">Slayre</a>, <a href="http://www.snailtrax.blogspot.com/">Snailtrax</a>, <a href="http://www.kebzweb.com/">Maudie</a>, <a href="http://foolandhismoney.blogspot.com/">-EV</a>, <a href="http://pokeramarama.blogspot.com/">Pokeramarama</a>, and newcomer/pokerbot, <a href="http://ankhorahil.livejournal.com/">Ankhorahil</a> (I'm sure I missed someone in there), but it was great fun, and I knew I wouldn't have to sit through tons of non-raked hands while trying to clear 910 hands in 7 days for that stinking 20% December deposit bonus. These folks gamble it up good.

First buy-in went when I slyly snuck my set of jacks into a set of kings. Rebuy! Eventually I bled down with the second buy-in and pushed my last $10 in with 99. A non-blogger called with QJ of spades and hit his flush on the river. Oh well. I jumped on a couple of other tables and made both buy-ins back. Plus I ended up with about 450 raked hands for the day, well on my way to clearing that bonus by Christmas.
