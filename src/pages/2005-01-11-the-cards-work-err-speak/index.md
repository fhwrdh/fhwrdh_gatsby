Congratulations toÂ <a href="http://cardsspeak.servebeer.com/archives/the_next_chapter.html">Hank </a>for landing a gig at Full Tilt. As I said in the comments of his post, 'jealous' is a bit of an understatement. Working in a business one is passionate about is huge. Its been quite a few years since I have done so (sigh). Best of luck, my friend.
