With Facty's parents visiting from the States, we toured Blarney, Cobh, Killarney, the Ring of Kerry, Bunratty Castle, Cliffs of Moher, and the Burren. This is detail of a stained glass window in Bunratty.

This was our second trip to some of these destinations, including Blarney Castle. I've still not been convinced to kiss the stone, which is at the very top of the wall on the left in this picture.

Cobh"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2170/2427854259_d14f2403c9_b.jpg" alt="St.

Cobh is a beautiful little port town just south of Cork, where many of the Irish immigrants through history boarded ships leaving Ireland for the last time. We happened to visit on the anniversary of the Titanic's arrival in Cobh (then known as Queenstown), which was its last stop before sinking. This cathedral, St. Colman's, dominates the skyline.

More photos from the trip are in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fhwrdh/sets/72157604640879596/">flickr set</a>, including these last two, for <a href="http://guinnessandpoker.blogspot.com/">Iggy</a>.

Bonus! Poker content! We found a very popular <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fhwrdh/2427892965/in/set-72157604640879596/">poker player</a> in the Ring of Kerry. He was kind enough to pose for a photo with Birdy.
