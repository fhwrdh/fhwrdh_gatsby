First off, thanks for everyone for the kind words about the new job. I can't wait to start. Giving notice at my current job went smoothly, and I'll be starting on the 24th.

On the WPBT front, I'm booked. Its going to be a short trip for me - fly in on Friday afternoon and out on Sunday morning. I heard the party was at the Plaza, so i booked there. <a href="http://www.alcanthang.com/poker/index.html">The Canthangs</a>, <a href="http://taopoker.blogspot.com/">Pauly</a>,  <a href="http://pokerintheweeds.blogspot.com/">Derek,</a> <a href="http://www.gamblingblues.com/">BG</a>, <a href="http://one2many.blogspot.com/">Bob</a>, <a href="http://www.kebzweb.com/">Maudie</a>, <a href="http://www.billrini.com/">Bill</a>....
