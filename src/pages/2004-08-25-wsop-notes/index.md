Last night's WSOP shows on ESPN had a number of great moments worth noting:

<ul>
    <li> Fischman, Boyd, Jungblut all going out. Perhaps now ESPN will stop with the ridiculous crew resets;</li>
    <li>Jungblut with his handwritten "fashionace.com" ad on his Pokerstars shirt. Nothing says high quality fashion like taking your sharpie to a shirt someone else if paying you to wear. I'm sure Pokerstars was happy with that. Btw, nice website. Did you get that done down at the local learning tree <em>Intro to HTML</em> class?</li>
    <li>Fischman getting schooled multiple times by Doyle Brunson. Did you hear that sound? That was the entire poker world cheering;</li>
    <li>The Raymer / Matusow incident. The more I see/read about Raymer, the more I like him. Matusow has secured his already solid spot on the root-against team with Hellmouth, the crew and others. I find it strange that a there are so many egomaniacs in a game that is so humbling due to the short-term luck involved.</li>
</ul>

Just to reiterate what other poker blogs have been saying, Pacific Poker is not good. I emailed them to try to get the password ( you know the one I can't change to something I can remember? ) for my account that I haven't used in ages. I received an automated reply that was so poorly worded that it sounded a little like they thought they had solved my problem already:

<blockquote>... i trust that the issue that you brought to our attention has been
resolved. if this is not the case, please contact us again and we will
address your concern. ...</blockquote>

Errrrr, actually, no, my problem has not been resolved. I replied to this and got the the exact same automated email from them. Sigh. This morning I gave up and just opened and funded a new account. Hopefully, I sent <a href="http://guinnessandpoker.blogspot.com/">Iggy</a> my new info in time for the Monty Memorial tourney.
