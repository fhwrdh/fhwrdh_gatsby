I do have a mildly interesting tale of trucking down to Commerce last Friday and watching the taping of the PPT final table (<a href="http://www.pokerpages.com/blog/index.php?itemid=153">results here</a>) but real life has crept in on multiple fronts, leaving little time for documentation. Perhaps this weekend.

I haven't even been playing much online since clearing a Pokernow initial deposit bonus last week. Likewise, no time to
really dig in to the new <a href="http://www.pokertrackerguide.com/">Pokertracker Guide</a>. Given the <a href="http://cardsspeak.servebeer.com/">illustrious</a> <a href="http://guinnessandpoker.blogspot.com/">authors</a> and a quick first glance through it, I am expecting great things. If you play online, you really should invest in
Pokertracker. and if you use Pokertracker, you should invest in a book that will help you get the most out of it, no?
