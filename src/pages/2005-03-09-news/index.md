Back in January, hot on the heels of Otis announcing his paid blogging gig, <a href="http://cardsspeak.servebeer.com/archives/the_next_chapter.html">Hdouble </a>announced that he was taking the leap and joining <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com">Full Tilt Poker</a>. Many were jealous and I was no exception. The fact that I was an early (beta tester) fan of Full Tilt and that they were located 7 miles from my current office made that pain all the more intense.

I wrote at the time, "...working in a business one is passionate about is huge. Its been quite a few years since I have done so (sigh). Best of luck, my friend." After thinking about that more, I realized that since I started working in technology in 1997, I have never worked in a business that I found interesting beyond the technical challenges. In fact, the last time I started a job I was passionate about and felt genuinely lucky to be a part of was in 1994! And then, that was the music business and it didn't take long for reality to set in. The point is, it's been a long time since I've had a chance to do something in a business I've been excited about.

While my path to an interview at Full Tilt was not as <a href="http://www.tiltboys.com">star-studded</a> as Hdouble's, it was no less serendipitous. I know a guy who knows a guy, and the next thing you know, I am speaking with some very smart folks about the online poker world and sneaking up on Hank to ask if he'll sign my printed copy of the <a href="http://www.pokertrackerguide.com">PokerTracker guide</a>.

My thanks to Hdouble (and Bloggs) for sweating me from the rail as I went through the process. and of course to Facty, my poker widow.

Oh, and I start at the end of the month. :)
