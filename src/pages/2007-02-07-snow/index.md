When we first got to Dublin, I was talking to a man about the weather and he told me that, while it does get cold, the last time it snowed was around 1982. The 30 minutes or so of snow today was not enough to make you east coast or mid-west types even blink, but for a Californian who can count on one hand the number of times he has been in the snow, it was a pretty cool surprise. I pried myself away from the desk and out onto the balcony for a few pictures and this video. Bonus points for the sun shining bright the whole time.
