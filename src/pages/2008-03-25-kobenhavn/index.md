Just back from four cold, snowy, windy, but ultimately great, days in and out of Copenhagen, Denmark. I'm still sorting through too many photos in search of a flickr set and trying to put together a proper recap of the trip. In the meantime, these two sit just outside Trinitatis Kirke, next to the amazing Rundetårn, or Round Tower.
