The bad part about Dr. Pauly killing himself to bring us all WSOP updates is that we are deprived of his blogger tourney writeups. Help make that sacrifice worth it, check out the <a href="http://taopoker.blogspot.com/">Tao of Poker</a> for regular updates direct from the floor of the WSOP. For photos, you can't do better than the <a href="http://www.lasvegasvegas.com/poker/2005wsopphotogallery.php">photo gallery</a> at LasVegasVegas.

I've also been keeping up with the <a href="http://www.cardplayer.com/poker_videos/">videos</a> that cardplayer has been producing and the <a href="http://www.expertinsight.com/_Podcast.html">podcasts </a>from Phil Gordon.
