Completely missed Wednesday's blogger tourney and have generally been off the grid for the last couple of weeks. but not without reasons.

First off, a job change. As noted earlier, I chased Hdouble to the river and ended up (figuratively) next to him at <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com">Full Tilt</a>. One week under the belt and all is well.

One side effect of leaving my previous job was giving back the nice laptop I was taking back and forth everyday. It became my primary machine, so giving it back left me without a comfortable machine for a while. I fixed that yesterday with a shiny new desktop machine. 3.0 ghz, 200gb hard drive, blah, blah, blah. Pretty great so far.

Then there is the sickness. I'm pretty sure its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis">the consumption</a> or something, I just cannot shake it. One more stinking <a href="http://www.ricola.com/">Ricola</a> and I'm going to snap.

To top it off, I finally got around to taking my car in to a mechanic to figure out the weird sound coming from the front wheels. Turns out the sound was $934.00. Ugh. I hate cars.

I've played hardly any live poker over the last few weeks and exactly 0 hands of online poker in that time. Its the longest layoff I've had since i started playing about 2 years ago. Somewhat ironic given the new job.

Off to an lkim home game...
