Hey, I finally finished a comment system for fhwrdh.net. A couple people had mentioned it to me, so I wrote one. It probably needs a little fine tuning, but if you get a chance to try it out, please do.

In the titlebar of each entry is a number in parenthesis (probably 0). This is the number of existing comments and also a link to the popup window where you can view and add to them.
